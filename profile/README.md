# Welcome to the iCal4j project

The iCal4j project offers Java-based libraries and services supporting interoperability standards such as iCalendar and vCard.

## Target Audience

iCal4j is primarily for developers interested in interoperability of data between software systems. This could be in the form of generating
new data (such as publishing events or contact details), or consuming existing data (e.g. tracking responses to invites, etc.).

## Contributing

Open Source software is a collaboration between developers and users, and we don't impose boundaries between them.

Your feedback, testing, fixes and suggestions are what drives the success of iCal4j, as we just don't have the
time and resources to focus on everything.

So let us know what you think, where we need to apply our focus, and how we can make this project a greater success.

And if you like what you see, and believe in our goals, feel free to volunteer some code, documentation or other
improvements by forking one of our repositories and submitting a pull request.

Thank you for your support!

The iCal4j team.
